# war_card_game_in_python
A Python implementation of the popular card game ‘War’<br>
War is a card game, typically played by two players using a standard playing card deck[2] — and often played by children. The deck is divided evenly among the players, giving each a down stack. In unison, each player reveals the top card of their deck—this is a battle —and The player with the higher card takes both of the cards played and moves them to their stack. Aces are high, and suits are ignored.<br>
